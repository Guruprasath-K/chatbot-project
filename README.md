# Chatbot

A simple chatbot interface built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The chatbot allows users to interact by sending messages and receives responses from predefined options or a default response when the input doesn't match any predefined responses.

## Features

- **User Interaction**: Users can type messages into the input field and send them to the chatbot.
- **Bot Responses**: The bot provides responses based on predefined options such as greetings, queries, and farewells.
- **Default Response**: If the user's input doesn't match any predefined responses, the bot provides a default response and prompts the user with additional options.
- **Toggle Button**: The chatbot interface can be toggled open or closed using a toggle button located in the corner of the screen.

## Usage

To use the chatbot:

1. Click on the toggle button located at the bottom right corner of the screen to open the chatbot interface.
2. Type a message in the input field and press Enter or click the send button.
3. The bot will respond with a predefined message or a default response.
4. Additional options may be provided by the bot for further interaction.
